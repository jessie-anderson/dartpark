# DartPark

DartPark is an application that allows users to buy and sell parking spots on and around Dartmouthâ€™s campus. Users can register as either renters or vendors; renters must be Dartmouth students, but vendors can be residents of Hanover, students, student organizations, the town of Hanover, or anyone else with spots available in Hanover. If a user is a student, they will have the option to create a vendor profile as well.

The app will allow renters to search for and buy parking spots based on location and price. Vendors will be able to list spots with location, description, and price. Payment will occur through the app.
